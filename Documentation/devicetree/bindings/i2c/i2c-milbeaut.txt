Milbeaut I2C

Required properties:
- compatible:        Must be "socionext,m20v-i2c".
- clocks:            Phandle to the clock used by the I2C module.
- interrupts:        Shared peripheral interrupt number of the device's set.
- reg:               Offset and length of the device's register set.
- clock-frequency:   SCL clock frequency.

Example:

	i2c0: i2c@1e003000 {
		compatible = "socionext,m20v-i2c";
		reg = <0x1e003000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <0 101 4>;
		clocks = <&pclk>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};
