Socionext Milbeaut PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	should be "socionext,milbeaut-pwm"
- reg:		physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- clocks:	phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock.
- #pwm-cells:	must be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
		description of the cell format.

Optional properties:
- base-rate:	set the rate of the clock to this at probe.

Example:

	pwm0: pwm@1e120000 {
		compatible = "socionext,milbeaut-pwm";
		reg = <0x1e001000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rclk>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
		base-rate = <13500000>;
	};
