* Milbeaut AHB DMA Controller

Milbeaut AHB DMA controller has transfer capability bellow.
 - memory to memory transfer
 - device to memory transfer
 - memory to device transfer

Required property:
- compatible:       Should be  "socionext,milbeaut_hdmac" for M10V
                    Should be  "socionext,milbeaut_m20v_hdmac" for M20V
- reg:              Should contain DMA registers location and length.
- interrupts:       Should contain all of the per-channel DMA interrupts.
- #dma-cells:       Should be 1.
- clocks:           Phandle to the clock used by the HDMAC module.

Optional properties:
- priority-rotate:  The priority of all DMA channels is rotated.

Example:

	hdmac1: hdmac@1e110000 {
		compatible = "socionext,milbeaut_hdmac";
		reg = <0x1e110000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 132 4>,
			     <0 133 4>,
			     <0 134 4>,
			     <0 135 4>,
			     <0 136 4>,
			     <0 137 4>,
			     <0 138 4>,
			     <0 139 4>;
		#dma-cells = <1>;
		priority-rotate;
		clocks = <&dummy_clk>;
	};

* DMA client

Clients have to specify the DMA requests with phandles in a list.

Required properties:
- dmas:             List of one or more DMA request specifiers. One DMA request specifier
                    consists of a phandle to the DMA controller followed by the integer
                    specifying the request line.
- dma-names:        List of string identifiers for the DMA requests. For the correct
                    names, have a look at the specific client driver.

Example:

	sni_spi1: spi@1e800100 {
		...
		dmas = <&hdmac1 22>, <&hdmac1 21>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		...
	};
